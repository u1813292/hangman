# Dependancies:
The only dependancies required for this terminal game are:
	
	- sys
	- and random-word

To install random-word use 
	
	```pip install random-word```

if you have both python 2.7 and python 3 installed and are unable to run this, try:
	
	```pip3 install random-word```

# How the game works:

So with the file there is 3 game rules defined, 
	
	1. The number of incorrect guesses allowed on the first run of the game (default = 7)
	2. The number of times you can run out of guesses (default = 1)
	3. The number of guesses given back if the player runs out of guesses (default = 3)

In order to play the game, once you have cloned this repository, navigate to the directory that the file is within.

This does require python3! This should be known as python 2.7 is no longer supported.

To run the game once in directory use the command 

	```python terminalHang.py```

If you still have python 2.7 installed and are having issues, try

	```python3 terminalHang.py```
